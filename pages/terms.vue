        Iconic Assistance's Service to arrange and schedule the fulfillment of
        requests of performance of various services (“Requests”) by providers of
        such services (each, an “Assistant”).
      </p>
      <p>1.1 Eligibility</p>
      <p>
        This is a contract between you and Iconic Assistance. You must read and
        agree to these terms before using the Iconic Assistance Service. If you
        do not agree, you may not use the Service. You may use the Service only
        if you can form a binding contract with Iconic Assistance, and only in
        compliance with this Agreement and all applicable local, state,
        national, and international laws, rules and regulations. Any use or
        access to the Service by anyone under 13 (or under 16 in Europe) is
        strictly prohibited and in violation of this Agreement. The Service is
        not available to any Users previously removed from the Service by Iconic
        Assistance.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some requests may not be made via the Service by users under 18 or 21
        years of age, as applicable. In certain instances, Iconic Assistance may
        require you to provide proof of identity to create your account, or to
        access or use the Service, and you acknowledge and agree that you may be
        denied access or use of the Service if you refuse to provide such proof.
      </p>
      <p>1.2 Limited License</p>
      <p>
        Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, you are hereby
        granted a non-exclusive, limited, non-transferable, freely revocable
        license to use the Service as permitted by the features of the Service.
        Iconic Assistance reserves all rights not expressly granted herein in
        the Service and the Iconic Assistance Content (as defined below). Iconic
        Assistance may terminate this license at any time for any reason or no
        reason.
      </p>
      <p>1.3 User Accounts</p>
      <p>
        Your account on the Service (your “User Account”) gives you access to
        the services and functionality that we may establish and maintain from
        time to time and at our sole discretion. We may maintain different types
        of User Accounts for different types of Users. If you open a User
        Account on behalf of a company, organization, or other entity, then (i)
        “you” includes you and that entity, and (ii) you represent and warrant
        that you are an authorized representative of the entity with the
        authority to bind the entity to this Agreement, and that you agree to
        this Agreement on the entity's behalf. By connecting to Iconic
        Assistance with a third-party service, you give us permission to access
        and use your information from that service as permitted by that service,
        and to store your log-in credentials for that service.
      </p>
      <p>
        You may never use another User's User Account without permission. When
        creating your User Account, you must provide accurate and complete
        information, and you must keep this information up to date. Your failure
        to maintain accurate, complete, and up-to-date account information may
        result in your inability to access and use the Service or our
        termination of this Agreement. You are solely responsible for the
        activity that occurs on your User Account, and you must keep your User
        Account password secure. We encourage you to use “strong” passwords
        (passwords that use a combination of upper and lower case letters,
        numbers and symbols) with your User Account. You must notify Iconic
        Assistance immediately of any breach of security or unauthorized use of
        your User Account. Iconic Assistance will not be liable for any losses
        caused by any unauthorized use of your User Account.
      </p>
      <p>
        By providing Iconic Assistance your email address you consent to our
        using the email address to send you Service-related notices, including
        any notices required by law, in lieu of communication by postal mail. We
        may also use your email address to send you other messages, such as
        changes to features of the Service and special offers. If you do not
        want to receive such email messages, you may opt out by emailing us at
        <span class="font-bold">contact@iconicassistants.com</span>. Opting out
        may prevent you from receiving email messages regarding updates,
        improvements, or offers.

        OF ANY THIRD PARTY; AND/OR (VIII) ANY TRANSACTION OR RELATIONSHIP
        BETWEEN YOU AND ANY ASSISTANT. IN NO EVENT SHALL ICONIC ASSISTANCE, ITS
        AFFILIATES, AGENTS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, SUPPLIERS, OR LICENSORS BE
        LIABLE TO YOU FOR ANY CLAIMS, PROCEEDINGS, LIABILITIES, OBLIGATIONS,
        DAMAGES, LOSSES OR COSTS IN AN AMOUNT EXCEEDING THE AMOUNT YOU PAID TO
        ICONIC ASSISTANCE HEREUNDER OR $100.00, WHICHEVER IS GREATER.

      <p>
        THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SECTION APPLIES WHETHER THE ALLEGED
        LIABILITY IS BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT, NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY, OR
        ANY OTHER BASIS, EVEN IF ICONIC ASSISTANCE HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
        POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE. THE FOREGOING LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL
        APPLY TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW IN THE APPLICABLE
        JURISDICTION.
      </p>
      <p>
        WITHOUT LIMITING THE FOREGOING, ICONIC ASSISTANCE DOES NOT WARRANT OR
        GUARANTEE THAT ASSISTANTS ARE TRAINED WITH ANY SPECIFIC SKILLS. YOU
        ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT MANAGEMENT OF ASSISTANTS IN PERFORMANCE OF
        REQUESTS IS YOUR SOLE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE USER, AND ICONIC ASSISTANCE
        IS NOT LIABLE FOR, AND EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL LIABILITY RELATING TO,
        ANY AND ALL ACTS OR OMISSIONS OF ASSISTANTS.
      </p>
      <p>
        SOME STATES DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR
        CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS OR EXCLUSIONS MAY NOT
        APPLY TO YOU. THIS AGREEMENT GIVES YOU SPECIFIC LEGAL RIGHTS, AND YOU
        MAY ALSO HAVE OTHER RIGHTS WHICH VARY FROM STATE TO STATE. THE
        DISCLAIMERS, EXCLUSIONS, AND LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY UNDER THIS
        AGREEMENT WILL NOT APPLY TO THE EXTENT PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE LAW.

        10. Governing Law, Arbitration, And Class Action/Jury Trial Waiver
      </h2>
      <p>
        10.1 Governing Law. You agree that: (i) the Service shall be deemed
        solely based in Florida; and (ii) the Service shall be deemed a passive
        one that does not give rise to personal jurisdiction over us, either
        specific or general, in jurisdictions other than Florida. This Agreement
        shall be governed by the internal substantive laws of the State of
        Florida, without respect to its conflict of laws principles. The parties
        acknowledge that this Agreement evidences a transaction involving
        interstate commerce. Notwithstanding the preceding sentences with
        respect to the substantive law, the Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C. §§
        1-16) (“FAA”) governs the interpretation and enforcement of the
        Arbitration Agreement in Section 10.2 and preempts all state laws to the
        fullest extent permitted by law. If the FAA is found to not apply to any
        issue that arises from or relates to the Arbitration Agreement, then
        that issue shall be resolved under and governed by the law of your state
        of residence. The application of the United Nations Convention on
        Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. You
        agree to submit to the exclusive personal jurisdiction of the federal
        and state courts located in Miami Dade County, Florida for any actions
        for which we retain the right to seek injunctive or other equitable
        relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or
        threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a our
        copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or other intellectual
        property or proprietary rights, as set forth in the Arbitration
        provision below, including any provisional relief required to prevent
        irreparable harm. You agree that Miami Dade County, Florida is the
        proper and exclusive forum for any appeals of an arbitration award or
        for trial court proceedings in the event that the arbitration provision
        below is found to be unenforceable.
      </p>
      <p>
        10.2 Arbitration. READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT REQUIRES THE
        PARTIES TO ARBITRATE THEIR DISPUTES AND LIMITS THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU
        CAN SEEK RELIEF FROM ICONIC ASSISTANCE. This Section 10.2(the
        “Arbitration Agreement”) applies to and governs any dispute,
        controversy, or claim between you and Iconic Assistance that arises out
        of or relates to, directly or indirectly: (a) this Agreement, including
        the formation, existence, breach, termination, enforcement,
        interpretation, validity, or enforceability thereof; (b) access to or
        use of the Service, including receipt of any advertising or marketing
        communications; (c) any transactions through, by, or using the Service;
        or (d) any other aspect of your relationship or transactions with Iconic
        Assistance, directly or indirectly, as a consumer (“Claim” or
        collectively, “Claims”). The Arbitration Agreement shall apply, without
        limitation, to all Claims that arose or were asserted before or after
        your agreement to this Agreement.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you are a new Iconic Assistance user, you can reject and opt-out of
        this Arbitration Agreement within 30 days of accepting this Agreement by
        emailing Iconic Assistance at
        <span class="font-bold">contact@iconicassistants.com</span>
        with your first and last name and stating your intent to opt-out of the
        Arbitration Agreement. Note that opting out of this Arbitration
        Agreement does not affect any other part of this Agreement, including
        the provisions regarding controlling law or in which courts any disputes
        must be brought.
      </p>
      <p>
        For any Claim, you agree to first contact us at
        <span class="font-bold">contact@iconicassistants.com</span>
        and attempt to resolve the dispute with us informally. In the unlikely
        event that Iconic Assistance has not been able to resolve a Claim after
        sixty (60) days, we each agree to resolve any Claim exclusively through
        binding arbitration by JAMS before a single arbitrator (the
        “Arbitrator”), under the Optional Expedited Arbitration Procedures then
        in effect for JAMS (the “Rules”), except as provided herein. In the
        event of any conflict between the Rules and this Arbitration Agreement,
        this Arbitration Agreement shall control. JAMS may be contacted at
        www.jamsadr.com, where the Rules are also available. The arbitration
        will be conducted in Miami Dade County, Florida, unless you and Iconic
        Assistance agree otherwise. If you are using the Service for commercial
        purposes, each party will be responsible for paying any JAMS filing,
        administrative and arbitrator fees in accordance with JAMS rules, and
        the award rendered by the arbitrator shall include costs of arbitration,
        reasonable attorneys' fees and reasonable costs for expert and other
        witnesses. If you are an individual using the Service for non-commercial
        purposes: (i) JAMS may require you to pay a fee for the initiation of
        your case, unless you apply for and successfully obtain a fee waiver
        from JAMS; (ii) the award rendered by the arbitrator may include your
        costs of arbitration, your reasonable attorney's fees, and your
        reasonable costs for expert and other witnesses; and (iii) you may sue
        in a small claims court of competent jurisdiction without first engaging
        in arbitration, but this does not absolve you of your commitment to
        engage in the informal dispute resolution process. Any judgment on the
        award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of
        competent jurisdiction. You and Iconic Assistance agree that the
        Arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court or agency, shall
        have exclusive authority to resolve any disputes relating to the
        interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of this
        Arbitration Agreement, including any claim that all or any part of this
        Arbitration Agreement is void or voidable. The Arbitrator shall also be
        responsible for determining all threshold arbitrability issues,
        including issues relating to whether the Agreement, any provision of the
        Agreement, is unconscionable or illusory and any defense to arbitration,
        including waiver, delay, laches, unconscionability, or estoppel.
      </p>
      <p>
        Nothing in this Section shall be deemed as: preventing Iconic Assistance
        from seeking injunctive or other equitable relief from the courts as
        necessary to prevent the actual or threatened infringement,
        misappropriation, or violation of our data security, intellectual
        property rights or other proprietary rights; or preventing you from
        asserting claims in small claims court, if your claims qualify and so
        long as the matter remains in such court and advances on only an
        individual (non-class, non-representative) basis.
      </p>
      <p>
        If this Arbitration Agreement is found to be void, unenforceable, or
        unlawful, in whole or in part, the void, unenforceable, or unlawful
        provision, in whole or in part, shall be severed. Severance of the void,
        unenforceable, or unlawful provision, in whole or in part, shall have no
        impact on the remaining provisions of the Arbitration Agreement, which
        shall remain in force, or the parties' ability to compel arbitration of
        any remaining claims on an individual basis pursuant to the Arbitration
        Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Class Action/Jury Trial
        Waiver is found to be void, unenforceable, or unlawful, in whole or in
        part, because it would prevent you from seeking public injunctive
        relief, then any dispute regarding the entitlement to such relief (and
        only that relief) must be severed from arbitration and may be litigated
        in a civil court of competent jurisdiction. All other claims for relief
        subject to arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement shall be
        arbitrated under its terms, and the parties agree that litigation of any
        dispute regarding the entitlement to public injunctive relief shall be
        stayed pending the outcome of any individual claims in arbitration.
      </p>
      <p>
        10.3 Class Action/Jury Trial Waiver. WITH RESPECT TO ALL PERSONS AND
        ENTITIES, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THEY HAVE OBTAINED OR USED THE SERVICE
        FOR PERSONAL, COMMERCIAL OR OTHER PURPOSES, ALL CLAIMS MUST BE BROUGHT
        IN THE PARTIES' INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS
        MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS ACTION, COLLECTIVE ACTION, PRIVATE
        ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. THIS WAIVER
        APPLIES TO CLASS ARBITRATION, AND, UNLESS WE AGREE OTHERWISE, THE
        ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON'S CLAIMS. YOU AND
        ICONIC ASSISTANCE AGREE THAT THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD RELIEF ONLY TO AN
        INDIVIDUAL CLAIMANT AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE RELIEF
        ON YOUR INDIVIDUAL CLAIM(S). ANY RELIEF AWARDED MAY NOT AFFECT OTHER
        ICONIC ASSISTANCE USERS. YOU AND ICONIC ASSISTANCE FURTHER AGREE THAT,
        BY ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT, YOU AND ICONIC ASSISTANCE ARE EACH
        WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO BRING, JOIN, OR PARTICIPATE
        IN A CLASS ACTION, COLLECTIVE ACTION, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION,
        OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING OF ANY KIND AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS
        MEMBER.

      <h2>11. Additional Terms For Mobile Applications</h2>
      <p>
        11.1 Mobile Applications. We may make available software to access the
        Service via a mobile device (“Mobile Applications”). To use any Mobile
        Applications you must have a mobile device that is compatible with the
        Mobile Applications. Iconic Assistance does not warrant that the Mobile
        Applications will be compatible with your mobile device. You may use
        mobile data in connection with the Mobile Applications and may incur
        additional charges from your wireless provider for these services. You
        agree that you are solely responsible for any such charges. Iconic
        Assistance hereby grants you a non-exclusive, non-transferable,
        revocable license to use a compiled code copy of the Mobile Applications
        for one Iconic Assitance User Account on one mobile device owned or
        leased solely by you, for your personal use. You may not: (i) modify,
        disassemble, decompile or reverse engineer the Mobile Applications,
        except to the extent that such restriction is expressly prohibited by
        law; (ii) rent, lease, loan, resell, sublicense, distribute or otherwise
        transfer the Mobile Applications to any third party or use the Mobile
        Applications to provide time sharing or similar services for any third
        party; (iii) make any copies of the Mobile Applications; (iv) remove,
        circumvent, disable, damage or otherwise interfere with security-related
        features of the Mobile Applications, features that prevent or restrict
        use or copying of any content accessible through the Mobile
        Applications, or features that enforce limitations on use of the Mobile
        Applications; or (v) delete the copyright and other proprietary rights
        notices on the Mobile Applications. You acknowledge that Iconic
        Assistance may from time to time issue upgraded versions of the Mobile
        Applications, and may automatically electronically upgrade the version
        of the Mobile Applications that you are using on your mobile device. You
        consent to such automatic upgrading on your mobile device, and agree
        that the terms and conditions of this Agreement will apply to all such
        upgrades. Any third-party code that may be incorporated in the Mobile
        Applications is covered by the applicable open source or third-party
        license EULA, if any, authorizing use of such code. The foregoing
        license grant is not a sale of the Mobile Applications or any copy
        thereof, and Iconic Assistance or its third-party partners or suppliers
        retain all right, title, and interest in the Mobile Applications (and
        any copy thereof). Any attempt by you to transfer any of the rights,
        duties or obligations hereunder, except as expressly provided for in
        this Agreement, is void. Iconic Assistance reserves all rights not
        expressly granted under this Agreement. If the Mobile Applications are
        being acquired on behalf of the United States Government, then the
        following provision applies. The Mobile Applications will be deemed to
        be “commercial computer software” and “commercial computer software
        documentation,” respectively, pursuant to DFAR Section 227.7202 and FAR
        Section 12.212, as applicable. Any use, reproduction, release,
        performance, display or disclosure of the Service and any accompanying
        documentation by the U.S. Government will be governed solely by these
        Terms of Service and is prohibited except to the extent expressly
        permitted by these Terms of Service. The Mobile Applications originate
        in the United States, and are subject to United States export laws and
        regulations. The Mobile Applications may not be exported or re-exported
        to certain countries or those persons or entities prohibited from
        receiving exports from the United States. In addition, the Mobile
        Applications may be subject to the import and export laws of other
        countries. You agree to comply with all United States and foreign laws
        related to use of the Mobile Applications and the Service.
      </p>
      <p>
        11.2 Mobile Applications from Apple App Store. The following applies to
        any Mobile Applications you acquire from the Apple App Store
        (“Apple-Sourced Software”): You acknowledge and agree that this
        Agreement is solely between you and Iconic Assistance, not Apple, Inc.
        (“Apple”) and that Apple has no responsibility for the Apple-Sourced
        Software or content thereof. Your use of the Apple-Sourced Software must
        comply with the App Store Terms of Service. You acknowledge that Apple
        has no obligation whatsoever to furnish any maintenance and support
        services with respect to the Apple-Sourced Software. In the event of any
        failure of the Apple-Sourced Software to conform to any applicable
        warranty, you may notify Apple, and Apple will refund the purchase price
        for the Apple-Sourced Software to you; to the maximum extent permitted
        by applicable law, Apple will have no other warranty obligation
        whatsoever with respect to the Apple-Sourced Software, and any other
        claims, losses, liabilities, damages, costs or expenses attributable to
        any failure to conform to any warranty will be solely governed by this
        Agreement and any law applicable to Iconic Assistance as provider of the
        software. You acknowledge that Apple is not responsible for addressing
        any claims of you or any third party relating to the Apple-Sourced
        Software or your possession and/or use of the Apple-Sourced Software,
        including, but not limited to: (i) product liability claims; (ii) any
        claim that the Apple-Sourced Software fails to conform to any applicable
        legal or regulatory requirement; and (iii) claims arising under consumer
        protection or similar legislation; and all such claims are governed
        solely by this Agreement and any law applicable to Iconic Assistance as
        provider of the software. You acknowledge that, in the event of any
        third-party claim that the Apple-Sourced Software or your possession and
        use of that Apple-Sourced Software infringes that third party's
        intellectual property rights, Iconic Assistance, not Apple, will be
        solely responsible for the investigation, defense, settlement and
        discharge of any such intellectual property infringement claim to the
        extent required by this Agreement. You and Iconic Assistance acknowledge
        and agree that Apple, and Apple's subsidiaries, are third-party
        beneficiaries of this Agreement as relates to your license of the
        Apple-Sourced Software, and that, upon your acceptance of the terms and
        conditions of this Agreement, Apple will have the right (and will be
        deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce this Agreement as relates
        to your license of the Apple-Sourced Software against you as a
        third-party beneficiary thereof.
      </p>
      <p>
        11.3 Mobile Applications from Google Play Store. The following applies
        to any Mobile Applications you acquire from the Google Play Store

        between you and Iconic Assistance only, and not with Google, Inc.
        (“Google”); (ii) your use of Google-Sourced Software must comply with
        Google's then-current Google Play Store Terms of Service; (iii) Google
        is only a provider of the Google Play Store where you obtained the
        Google-Sourced Software; (iv) Iconic Assistance, and not Google, is
        solely responsible for its Google-Sourced Software; (v) Google has no
        obligation or liability to you with respect to Google-Sourced Software
        or the Agreement; and (vi) you acknowledge and agree that Google is a
        third-party beneficiary to the Agreement as it relates to Iconic
        Assistance's Google-Sourced Software.

        agreement between you and Iconic Assistance concerning the Service.
        Except as otherwise stated in Section 10.2, if any provision of this
        Agreement is deemed invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the
        invalidity of such provision shall not affect the validity of the
        remaining provisions of this Agreement, which shall remain in full force
        and effect.
      </p>
      <p>
        12.4 No Waiver. No waiver of any term of this Agreement shall be deemed
        a further or continuing waiver of such term or any other term, and
        Iconic Assistance's failure to assert any right or provision under this
