      <p>Categories of personal information we collect can include:</p>

          information we collect may include your name, mobile number, mailing
          address, email address, date of birth, and any other information
          necessary to fulfil your request. You should feel free to decline to
          provide any information that we request, however, please note that
          doing so may make it impossible for Iconic Assistance to fulfil your
          request. We use the information that we collect to provide the
          products or services that you request, to improve and customize our
          Service, and to contact you about special promotions and new products.
          We also receive personally identifiable information when you apply for
          a job in the “employment” section of the website. Any such information
          gathered through that section will be used solely to evaluate whether
          your background and experience make you a candidate for a career with
          Iconic Assistance.
        </li>
        <li>
          Information We Collect from Third Parties. We may collect information

          services and from publicly available sources. For example, we may
          receive information about you when you interact with our site through

          following us on Twitter or by logging in to our service through

        2. HOW WE USE COOKIES AND OTHER TRACKING TECHNOLOGY TO COLLECT
        INFORMATION
      </h2>
      <p>Pixel Tags and Cookies</p>
      <div class="w-full columnAlignCenter gap-3">
        <p>
          We and our third party partners may automatically collect certain
          types of usage information when you visit our website or use our
          Service. For instance, when you visit our website, we may send one or
          more cookies—a small text file containing a string of alphanumeric
          characters—to your computer that uniquely identifies your browser and
          lets us enhance your navigation through the site. A cookie may also
          convey information to us about how you use our website (e.g., the
          pages you view, the links you click, how frequently you access our
          website, and other actions you take on our website), and allow us to
          track your usage of the Service over time. We may collect log file
          information about your browser or mobile device each time you access
          the Service. Log file information may include anonymous information
          such as your web request, Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, browser
          type, information about your mobile device, referring / exit pages and
          URLs, number of clicks and how you interact with links on our website,
          domain names, landing pages, pages viewed, and other such information.
          The information allows for more accurate reporting and improvement of
          our website.
        </p>
        <p>
          We also use an email delivery and marketing company to send emails.
          Pixel tags and cookies are used in those email messages and at our
          website to help us measure the effectiveness of our marketing and how
          visitors use our site. Pixel tags (sometimes also called “clear GIFs”)
          are small graphic files, invisible to the human eye, which allow
          websites or other online services to track users. Iconic Assistance
          and our third-party advertising company use pixel tags in HTML-enabled
          email to track whether (and when) the recipient opened the message.
        </p>
        <p>
          We may also collect analytics data, or use third-party analytics
          tools, to help us measure traffic and usage trends for our website.
          These tools collect information sent by your browser or mobile device,
          including the pages you visit, your use of third party applications,
          and other information that assists us in analyzing and improving our
          website. When you access our website by or through a mobile device, we
          may receive or collect and store a unique identification number
          associated with your device (for example, a UDID, IDFA, Google
          Advertising ID or similar), mobile carrier, device type and
          manufacturer, and phone number.
        </p>
        <p>
          We may use the data collected through cookies, log file, device
          identifiers, location data and pixel tags to: (a) remember information
          so that you will not have to re-enter it the next time you use our
          Service; (b) provide custom, personalized content and information,
          including advertising; (c) provide and monitor the effectiveness of
          our website and our email communications; (d) monitor aggregate
          metrics such as total number of visitors, traffic, usage, and
          demographic patterns on our website; (e) diagnose or fix technology
          problems; and (f) otherwise to plan for and enhance our website. The
          information we collect through these tracking technologies may be
          linked to the Personal Information you have chosen to share with us
          when you register.

        <h3>Third Party Tracking And Online Advertising</h3>
        <p>
          We permit third party online advertising networks to collect
          information about your use of our website over time so that they may
          play or display ads that may be relevant to your interests on our
          website as well as on other websites or services. Typically, the
          information is collected through cookies or similar tracking
          technologies. You may “opt out” of the collection of any information
          through cookies or other tracking technology by managing the
          preferences or settings on your browser or mobile device. However, if
